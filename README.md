## Abstract:
Treatment with adjuvant osimertinib for three years is the standard-of-care for resected, stage IB-IIIA harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant NSCLC. The role of neoadjuvant osimertinib in perioperative setting is yet to be elucidated in the NeoADAURA study (NCT04351555). Here, we elucidate the clinical activity and surgical outcomes after 8 weeks of neoadjuvant osimertinib, and identify the drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) that may potentially dampen the response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Our study highlights the 5 distinct clusters in post-osimertinib treated patients.
